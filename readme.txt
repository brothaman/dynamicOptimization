A directory containing examples in dynamic programming/optimization.
These examples were precursory to my thesis. They were used to attain
a basic understanding of the programmatic implementation of markov 
decision process. 


The original Matlab Code by given by Ricard Torres here http://ciep.itam.mx/~rtorres/progdin/
These examples given on page 9 the book Dynamic Programming by Denardo's. 


I will post the contents of my thesis upon completion on 11/29/18
